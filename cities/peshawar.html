                        <h3>Peshawar</h3>
                        <p>
                            The area encompassing modern-day Peshawar is
                            mentioned in Vedic scriptures; it served as the
                            capital of the Kushan Empire during <br />the rule
                            of Kanishka[15][16][17] and was home to the Kanishka
                            Stupa, which was among the tallest buildings in the
                            ancient world. <br />Peshawar was then ruled by the
                            Hephthalites, followed by the Hindu Shahis, before
                            the arrival of a variety of Muslim empires.
                            <br />The city was an important trading centre of
                            the Mughal Empire before becoming part of the
                            Durrani Empire in 1747, after which it <br />served
                            as the Durrani winter capital from 1776 until the
                            capture of the city by the Sikh Empire in 1823. In
                            1849, the city was <br />captured by the East India
                            Company and subsequently became part of British Raj,
                            under whose rule it remained until the Partition
                            <br />of British India and subsequent independence
                            of Pakistan in 1947.
