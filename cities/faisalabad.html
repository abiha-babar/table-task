                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Faisalabad, formerly (until 1979) Lyallpur, is a
                            city in the east-central Punjab province of
                            Pakistan,<br />
                            in the Rechna Doab upland. When founded in 1890, it
                            was named for Sir Charles James Lyall, lieutenant
                            governor<br />
                            of the Punjab. It became headquarters of the Lower
                            Chenab colony and in 1898 was incorporated as a
                            municipality. [14]<br />
                            In September 1977, the city of Lyallpur was renamed
                            "Faisalabad" by the Government of Pakistan in honor
                            of King Faisal of <br />
                            Saudi Arabia who had a great love for Pakistan and
                            its people.[15]â€Š<br />
                            At the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in
                            1849, the entire Punjab region became administered
                            as Punjab <br />
                            province, firstly by the East India Company and
                            after 1858 as part of the British Raj.[25][26]<br />
                            <br />
                            In the 1880s the Punjab government began an
                            irrigation scheme to cultivate large tracts of
                            western<br />
                            Punjab through the creation of canal colonies.[27]
                            The Chenab colony was the largest of these
                            colonisation<br />
                            projects, and covered the entirety of present-day
                            Faisalabad district. Popham Young, the Colonisation
                            Officer <br />
                            managing the project identified the site of the
                            current city to establish headquarters for the
                            colony.[17][28]<br />
                            <br />
                            In 1904, the new district of Lyallpur was created to
                            include the tehsils of Samundri and Toba <br />
                            Tek Singh with a sub-tehsil at Jaranwala, which
                            later became a full tehsil in itself.[34] The <br />
                            University of Agriculture, originally the Punjab
                            Agricultural College and Research Institute, <br />
                            Lyallpur, was established in 1906.[16] The Town
                            Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee
                            <br />
                            in 1909. Lyallpur grew into an established
                            agricultural tool and grain centre.[35] By 1911 the
                            <br />
                            city had a population of 19,578.[17] The 1930s
                            brought industrial growth and market expansion
                            <br />
                            to the textile industry as well as to food
                            processing, grain crushing and chemicals.[18]
