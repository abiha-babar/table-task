                        <h3>Multan</h3>
                        <p>
                            Multan is one of the oldest continuously inhabited
                            cities in Asia, with a history stretching deep into
                            antiquity. <br />The ancient city was the site of
                            the renowned Multan Sun Temple, and was besieged by
                            Alexander the Great during the <br />Mallian
                            Campaign.[10] A historic cultural centre of the
                            wider Punjab,[11] it was conquered by the Ummayad
                            military <br />commander Muhammad bin Qasim.[12] The
                            city later became independent as the capital of the
                            Emirate of Multan in 855 A.D., <br />before
                            subsequently coming under the rule of empires such
                            as the Ghaznavids, the Ghurids and the Mamluks.
                            <br />In 1445, it became capital of the Langah
                            Sultanate. In 1526, it was conquered by the Mughal
                            Empire. Multan <br />Subah would become one of the
                            largest provinces of the Mughal Empire when it was
                            created by administrative <br />reforms of Emperor
                            Akbar.[13] Afterwards, Multan became part of the
                            Durrani and Sikh empires successively. <br />In
                            1848, it was conquered by the British Empire and
                            became part of British Punjab. After independence,
                            it became part of Pakistan.
