                            Lahore's origins reach into antiquity. The city has
                            been inhabited for at least two millennia, although
                            it rose to<br />
                            prominence in the 10th century.[19] Lahore was the
                            capital of multiple empires throughout its history,
                            including the<br />
                            Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavids, and Delhi Sultanate in the
                            medieval era. Lahore reached the height of its
                            splendor under <br />
                            the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early
                            18th century and served as its capital city for many
                            years. <br />
                            The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid
                            ruler Nader Shah in 1739. Although the Mughal
                            authority was<br />
                            re-established, it fell into a period of decay while
                            being contested among the Afghans and the Sikhs
                            between<br />
                            1748 and 1798. Lahore eventually became the capital
                            of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century,
                            regaining <br />
                            some of its lost grandeur.[20] Lahore was annexed to
                            the British Raj in 1849 and became the capital of
                            British <br />
                            Punjab.[21] Lahore was central to the independence
                            movements of both India and Pakistan, with the city
                            being<br />
                            the site of both the declaration of Indian
                            Independence and the resolution calling for the
                            establishment of <br />
                            Pakistan. It experienced some of the worst riotings
                            during the Partition period preceding Pakistan's
                            independence.<br />
                            [22] Following the success of the Pakistan Movement
                            and the subsequent partition of British India in
                            1947, Lahore was <br />
                            declared the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.
